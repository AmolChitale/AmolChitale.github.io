      <h2>Dehradun</h2>
      <p>
        Dehradun is one of the oldest cities in India. In the Vedic times, the
        Garhwal Mandal, of which Dehradun is a part, was known as the Kedar
        Khand. Legend has it that Guru Dronacharaya, a Brahmin teacher of
        warfare, considered Dehradun a place fit for meditation &amp; worship
        and therefore, the valley of Doon was christened Drona Ashram, which
        means “The Abode of Drona”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dehradun is situated in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand (formerly
        Uttar Pradesh) around 235 km from Delhi. Dehradun extends from the
        latitude 30° 19’ in the North to longitude 78° 04’ in the East. The City
        of Dehradun is well connected to other cities of North India by rail,
        road, and air<strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to its location in the hilly part of the state, the climate of
        Dehradun is salubrious. During the summer months, the temperature ranges
        between 36°C and 16.7° C. The winter months are colder with the maximum
        and minimum temperatures touching 23.4°C and 5.2° C respectively.
